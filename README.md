# 52167-Project
GMIT Programming and scripting project 2018

[Project description document](doc/GMIT_Project_Description.pdf)

## To be completed

- [ ] Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
- [ ] Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
- [ ] Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
- [ ] Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
- [ ] Write a summary of your investigations.
- [ ] Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

## Background information on the Iris Dataset
![Iris Setosa Sample](http://www.twofrog.com/images/iris38a.jpg)

There seems to be vast amounts of information on the topic(About 5,230,000 results on google) of the iris dataset and several studies and papers derived around the subject and used as examples to explain statistics and statistical analyses of datasets.

The raw dataset is available from various sources online but the main set for this excercise was obtained from University of California's Machine Learning repositort cited in the list of references below.

The dataset consists of 150 instances of three classes with 4 attributes for every class.

Attribute Information:
1. sepal length in cm
1. sepal width in cm
1. petal length in cm
1. petal width in cm
1. class: 
   1. Iris Setosa
   1. Iris Versicolour
   1. Iris Virginica

In order to be effective in deriving a meaning conclusion or perform any kind of analyses on the data, one needs to clarify the values recorded in the set, so basically understand what sepal and a petal is.

![Petal and Sepal](https://www.wpclipart.com/plants/diagrams/plant_parts/petal_sepal_label.png)

So a petal is the obvious that most of us know from regual flowers and the sepal is the more rgid typically stem coloured part of the flower supporting the petals. In Iris flowers this is more confusing as sepals tends to look like petals being a similar colour, however they would be behind petals performing the function of sepals.
